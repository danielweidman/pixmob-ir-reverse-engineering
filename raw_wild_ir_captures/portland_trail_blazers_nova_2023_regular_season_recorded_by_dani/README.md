The Portland Trail Blazers (at the Moda Center) appear to have done a semi-permanent installation of PixMob Novas (not Nova Pro like at SAP center) in a few locations around the arena, mainly the handrailings by the entrances for the 300 level sections, and the railings between the suite and 200 level sections. They seem to be used rather sparingly though (mostly during player intros, national anthem, and end of the game).
