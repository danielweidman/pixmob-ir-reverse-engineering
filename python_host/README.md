This folder contains the main code for controlling the PixMob bracelets.

Prerequisite: must have already set up an Arduino with a sketch from the "arduino_sender" and hooked up an IR LED/transmitter.

To control your PixMob bracelets, use either demo_single_effect.py or demo_multiple_effects.py. Instructions are provided in each file.

TODO: If would rather use a Flipper device to send codes without a computer, see: [https://github.com/danielweidman/flipper-pixmob-ir-codes](https://github.com/danielweidman/flipper-pixmob-ir-codes)
